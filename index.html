        <h2>The Results Are In!</h2>
        <p>
          The votes are now counted and the results are as follows:
          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain1();">Likud - 30</button></ul>
<div id="explanation1" class="hide1">
  Founded in 1973 and currectly led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud has been the dominant force in Israeli politics since Netanyahu led them to victory in 2009 - earning his party 27 seats (second only to Kadima). In spite of this, Netanyahu was able to form a coalition after a month of negotiations. <br></br>
  Traditionally, the Likud has been against the formation of a Palestinian state although, although recent negotiations with the Palestinians and the United States under the Trump administration show that Netanyahu would prefer a two-state solution, albeit with "limited sovereignty" for the Palestinians. <br></br>
  Likud has been in support of settlements in the West Bank, with Netanyahu trying to legalize numerous smaller outposts that even the State of Israel considers to be illegal. As a result of this Likud has been able to court the support of settlers, religious zionists, and right-wing religious parties.<br></br>
  Economically Likud has remained faithful to Netanyahu's reforms in 2003 which are creditied with transforming the Israeli economy. These include the reduction of unemployment benefits, cutting taxes for high earners and corporations, instituting free-trade with the United States and Europe, fighting against monopolies and cartels (such as seaports and communications companies), and privatizing land ownership and other major businesses like El Al and Bank Leumi. While controversial, Netanyahu credits these free-market and liberal policies with producing Israel's world famous high-tech boom. Critics say that while the reduction in unemployment and the increse in national GDP (45% increase from 2009 to 2018 vs the OECD average of 34%) is undeniably impressive, housing prices, the high cost of living, and low GDP per capita indicate that Israel still has a long way to go.<br></br>
  While Likud enjoyed the largest voter base of any party with 1,066,595 Israelis casting their ballot for the Netanyahu-led party, it was a noticable drop from a year ago when Likud received 285,000 more votes than it did this time around.

         <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain2();">Yesh Atid - 17</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation2" class="hide1">
  Founded in 2012 by former journalist Yair Lapid, Yesh Atid (Hebrew for "there is a future") has been popular amongst middle and higher-income Israelis due to their focus on economic and social issues rather than those related to security.<br></br>
  In fact, the first of the party's stated "8 goals" is "changing the priorities in Israel" putting an emphasis on education, housing, health, transportation, and policing - areas where Israel lags significantly compared to other OECD countries. In addition, Yesh Atid has been a strong advocate for political reform - demanding an end to political corruption (for example forbidding the creation of "ministers without portfolios") and enacting a constitution.<br></br> 
  A major platform policy of Yesh Atid is to end the exemption that Ultra-Orthodox men enjoy from the army. Additionally Yesh Atid has advocated for more Arabs and Ultra-Orthodox to join the workforce, although has stopped short at advocating for Israeli-Arabs to join the IDF with one Yesh Atid lawmaker saying, "We're just not there yet." Yesh Atid's problems with the Ultra-Orthodox community go even further as the party seeks to institute civil and gay marriage equality in Israel, partial opening of public transport on Shabbat, and allowing for public funding of non-Orthodox Jewish movements within Israel, such as the Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic sects.<br></br>
  Even though Yesh Atid is the second largest party in the Knesset, there remains a strong possibility that Lapid will be given the mandate to form a government. Currently Yesh Atid is in talks with the heads of Labor, New Hope, Metetz, and Yisrael Beytenu and will likely meet with Blue and White, the Joint List, and Ra'am in an effort to build up what is being called the "Change Bloc." Lapid hopes to present the support of at least 61 MKs (members of Knesset) to President Reuven Rivlin who will give one MP the chance to form a government on April 7th.

        <h2>So this leads to the biggest question: who won?</h2>
        <p>
          At the moment - nobody - and we may not have that answer for a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          While that question is being answered there are a few things we need to understand. The Israeli political system is very different from the American or even the British - even though the later also follows a parlimentary system - and as a result we should all make sure we're on the same page.
        <section class="questionaire">
          <div>
            <button type="button" class="question" name="tab" onclick="question1();"/>
            How is a government decided in Israel?</button>
          </div><br>
          <div id="answer1" class="hide"><br></br>
            As we said, it is a parliamentary system in Israel and, as a result, voters cast ballots based on political parties rather than specific individuals (even though certain individuals may be the face of a party). There are 120 seats in the Israeli parliament, aka the Knesset, and whoever holds a majority of those seats would pick a prime minister and run the country. HOWEVER, in all of Israel's history no single party has ever won a majority (61 seats) meaning that different political parties must form coalitions with each other in order to hold power.
          </div>
        <br>
          <div>
            <button type="button" class="question" name="tab" onclick="question2();"/>
          Okay, so who decides who gets to form a coalition?</button>
          </div><br>
        <div id="answer2" class="hide">
          <br></br>The president of Israel is the person who gets to assign the responsibility of forming a government! <br>
        </br> The Basic Laws (which are the constitutional laws governing the state in the absence of an actual constitution) saw that the president has 7 days after the election results are published to assign the task to one lucky Knesset Member (KM). That person has 28 days to form a coalition although they can request an additional 14 days for a total for 42 days.<br></br> 
        <div>
          <button type="button" class="question1" name="tab" 
          onclick="question4();">
        How does the president decide?</button>
      </div>
      <div id="answer4" class="hide1"><br></br>
        Good question - and to be honest the Basic Laws don't provide a clear answer. It's primarily up to the president's discretion to decide which volunteer gets to form a government. The only exception is if the Knesset has voted to disolve itself, during which the President must wait until after the election before assigning that duty to someone.
        </div>

        <div>
          <button type="button" class="question" name="tab" 
          onclick="question3();">
          So who most likely will try and form the coalition?</button>
        </div><br>
        <div id="answer3" class="hide"><br></br>
          Typically the president assigns the duty to the leader of the largest party, but it's not a requirement. Ideally the president would give the responsibility to whoever has the greatest chance of actually forming a functioning government.
