          <h1>The ICC Has Opened An Investigation Against Israel</h1>
          <p>On March 3, 2021 the ICC Chief Prosecutor's office made a surprise announcement - the ICC was making a formal investigation into the "Situation in Palestine." What does that mean? It means that the ICC is going to be looking into potential war crimes that have been committed in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza that may or may not have been perpetrated by Israel and Hamas since June 13, 2014. Considered to be a "court of last resort," the ICC's decision has sparked both massive condemnation and incredible celebration based on where you sit on the issues. You got questions? We got answers! Click below to get more relevant and contextual information on this important event.</p>
          <ul><button type="button" class="iccquestions" onclick="iccexplain1();">Does the ICC even have jurisdiction in the Palestinian territories?</button></ul>
          <div id="iccexplaination1" class="icchide">Short answer: yes. <br></br> Long answer: on November 29, 2012 the United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 67/19 which upgraded Palestine's statue from a "observer entity" to a "non-member observer state." Nearly 2 years later, in August 2014,  ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda made a groundbreaking announcement based on a liberal interpretation of the Rome Statute's bylaws that since Palestine had been upgraded to "non-member observer state," it could now join the ICC and make appeals to this international body. By April 2015 the ICC fully accepted Palestine as a state party and granted ICC jurisdiction over not just the State of Palestine, but over all "Occupied Palestinian Territory."</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="iccquestions" onclick="iccexplain2();">Why such a specific date?</button></ul>
          <div id="iccexplaination2" class="icchide">This date isn't a coincidence. On June 12, 2014 Hamas terrorists kidnapped and murdered 3 Israeli teenagers in the West Bank. The ICC can't just decide it's going to investigate a country, it has to be invited and, in this case, it has been. The State of Palestine requested the timeline of this investigation begin on the day after the kidnapping and killing in a move that has deeply angered Israeli observers who note that the kidnapping, and those who may have given the order for it, won't be investigated.</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="iccquestions" onclick="iccexplain3();">What's Israel saying?</button></ul> <div id="iccexplaination3" class="icchide">Aside from historically saying that the ICC is unfair and biased towards them? So far, not a lot, which is a problem since Israel only has until the 9th of April to apply for a deferral. Israel signed the Rome Statute in 2000 but never ratified that signature, so it isn't technically a part of the ICC meaning they have no legal jurisdiction over them. In the meantime, Israel is reaching out to its allies in Europe and the United States, trying to find support from nations who would be able to help them delegitimize the probe and its potentially unfavorable findings. In Israel's opinion, the whole thing is completely illegal since, in their view, Palestine isn't considered a state. But in this case, it's prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's decision, and she's going through with it. <br></br>In the past Israel has made the case that the probe is in complete violation of Israeli sovereignty, and that the state has an independent and unbiased legal system already in place which is perfectly capable of conducting its own investigations. Even Bensouda is finding it hard to disagree with that one. That being said, Israel needs to make a decision regarding the probe, since burying your head in the sand isn't usually a great way to handle international investigations. If Israel ignores the probe, then it won't have any ability to influence it one way or another. On the other hand, by cooperating with it Israel is going back on its word, and essentially acknowledging that the ICC does indeed have jurisdiction over the Jewish state. Decisions, decisions. In the meantime, likely in order to punish the Palestinians and to prevent further talks between Bensouda and Al Malki that can't be electronically monitored, Israel has revoked the travel permit of Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al Malki.</div> 
          <ul><button type="button" class="iccquestions" onclick="iccexplain4();">Who is at risk of getting prosecuted and how bad is the punishment?</button></ul>
          <div id="iccexplaination4" class="icchide">The good news for the regular foot soldier is that they don't have anything to fear (unless they did something truly terrible, like commit a massacre against civilians), ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's investigation is targeted at high ranking military officers and government officials - essentially the people who were giving the orders. Israel has already drawn up a list of hundreds of its citizens who may find themselves under investigation and, in the future, many of them may expect warnings against travel to any countries who are signatories of the Rome Statute in order to avoid getting arrested abroad. <br></br>As for what could happen to those convicted, it's tough to say. According to the ICC website, since 2002 only 3 people have actually been handed prison time and their sentences have ranged from 9 - 14 years. Many are still at large simply because their home countries refuse to arrest them. Currently the Israeli strategy is to try and drum up as much international support for its side of the story, meaning that even countries who are signatories of the Rome Statute may invalidate the ICC's ruling.</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="iccquestions" onclick="iccexplain5();">What's the US saying about all this?</button></ul>
          <div id="iccexplaination5" class="icchide">Washington didn't hesitate to voice its opposition towards ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's decision to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in the West Bank and Gaza. Generally the US, even under the Biden administration, sides with Israel, including in this case; saying that since Israel isn't a signatory to the Rome Statute, and Palestine doesn't count as a sovereign state, the ICC has no jurisdiction over the region. This does come on the heels though of the US softening its relationship to the ICC and specifically towards Bensouda<br></br>A little recent history between the US and ICC: on March 5, 2020 the Appeals Chamber of the ICC decided to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan after " submissions of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, representatives of victims and other participants" (ICC website) appealed to the court. The ICC would look into the conduct of US, Afghan, and Taliban troops, although reports indicated that the scope of the investigation may continue to CIA blacksites in Poland, Lithuania, and Romania, places where where the US took detainees. As a response, in June 2020, then-president Trump authorized sanctions by executive order to be carried out against ICC officials and even their families. On September 2, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stood in front of the ICC and called the organization a, “thoroughly broken and corrupted institution” before announcing additional sanctions on Chief Prosecutor Bensouda herself. This was a completely unprecedented move, one that Bensouda herself described as, "the kind of sanctions that we normally reserve to be used as a mechanism to target narcotic traffickers, notorious terrorists and the like. But not professional lawyers, not prosecutors, not investigators, not judges." So yea, the US, isn't too friendly with the ICC either. While the impending investigation into Israel and Palestine was never mentioned at the time, the White House press statement later did mention that it was a variable when it came to making this decision.<br></br>Back to the present: despite AIPAC lobbying the Biden admin to maintain sanctions on the ICC, Biden, on April 2, 2021, announced that the US would be lifting all sanctions against the ICC with Secretary of State Antony Blinken adding this little qualifier: "We continue to disagree strongly with the ICC's actions relating to the Afghanistan and Palestinian situations." Prior to the ICC announcement, Blinken spoke with Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, likely to discuss the ICC decision with Blinken giving Ashkenazi a likely hint into how the Biden admin will treat the Israel-Palestine issue by informing him that the Biden administration believes that, "Israelis and Palestinians should enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, prosperity, and democracy."</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="iccquestions" onclick="iccexplain6();">Can Israel do anything to stop this investigation before it begins?</button></ul><div id="iccexplaination6" class="icchide">After formal notices by the ICC were sent to Israel on March 9, 2021, Israel was given 1 month to apply for a deferral. In order to receive that deferral, Israel has to prove that they are already conducting an internal investigation into the crimes that the ICC plans to investigate. The ICC is considered to be the court of last resort, and is only meant to investigate countries who don't have the means or ability to investigate themselves (such as when the court convicted Al Qaeda leader Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi in Mali or warlord Germain Katanga of the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Israel, being a first-world democracy, does have the means to investigate itself, so it's likely that the investigation will take place against Hamas and the Palestinian elements... which will inevitably uncover incidents involving Israeli soldiers that will be made public damaging Israel's image in the world. It also appears that ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, whose 9-year term expires in June 2021, is determined to open the case as a way to both leave a legacy, and in order to navigate the court's future priorities. This is likely an opportune moment to do so considering that her replacement, British barrister Karim Khan, is favored by Israel and considered by them to be a "pragmatist," meaning its unlikely he would have opened this case against Israel. Once it's already open and on his desk by the time he takes office, who knows where that will lead.

        <h1>You May Have Heard About The Election And, Well...</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="news" id="headline">
        <h2>The Results Are In!</h2>
        <p>
          The votes are now counted and the results are as follows (click to read about each party):
          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain1();">Likud - 30</button></ul>
<div id="explanation1" class="hide1">
  Founded in 1973, and currently led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud has been the dominant force in Israeli politics since Netanyahu led them to victory in 2009 - earning his party 27 seats (second only to rival party, Kadima, at the time). In spite of having less seats, Netanyahu was still able to form a coalition after a month of negotiations. <br></br>
  Traditionally, the Likud has been against the formation of a Palestinian state, although recent negotiations with the Palestinians and the United States under the Trump administration show that Netanyahu would prefer a two-state solution, albeit with "limited sovereignty" for the Palestinians. <br></br>
  Likud has been in support of settlements in the West Bank, with Netanyahu trying to legalize numerous smaller outposts that even the State of Israel considers to be illegal. As a result of this, Likud has been able to court the support of settlers, religious Zionists, and right-wing religious parties.<br></br>
  Economically Likud has remained faithful to Netanyahu's reforms in 2003 which are credited with transforming the Israeli economy. These liberal reforms include the reduction of unemployment benefits, cutting taxes for high earners and corporations, instituting free-trade with the United States and Europe, fighting against monopolies and cartels (such as seaports and communications companies), and privatizing land ownership and other major businesses like El Al and Bank Leumi. While controversial, Netanyahu credits these free-market and liberal policies with producing Israel's world famous high-tech boom. Critics say that while the reduction in unemployment and the increase in national GDP (45% increase from 2009 to 2018 vs the OECD average of 34%) is undeniably impressive, housing prices, the high cost of living, and low GDP per capita indicate that Israel still has a long way to go.<br></br>
  While Likud enjoyed the largest voter base of any party with 1,066,595 Israelis casting their ballot for the Netanyahu-led party, the party still faced a noticeable drop down from a year ago when Likud received 285,000 more votes than it did this time around.  
</div>
         <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain2();">Yesh Atid - 17</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation2" class="hide1">
  Founded in 2012 by former journalist Yair Lapid, Yesh Atid (Hebrew for "there is a future") has been popular primarily amongst middle and higher-income Israelis due to their focus on economic and social issues rather than those related to security.<br></br>
  In fact, the first of the party's stated "8 goals" is "changing the priorities in Israel" putting an emphasis on education, housing, health, transportation, and policing - areas where Israel lags significantly compared to other OECD countries. In addition, Yesh Atid has been a strong advocate for political reform - demanding an end to political corruption (for example forbidding the creation of "ministers without portfolios") and enacting a constitution.<br></br> 
  A major platform policy of Yesh Atid is to end the exemption that Ultra-Orthodox men enjoy from having to serve in the Israeli army. Additionally Yesh Atid has advocated for more Arabs and Ultra-Orthodox to join the workforce, although has stopped short of advocating for Israeli-Arabs to join the IDF, with one Yesh Atid lawmaker saying, "We're just not there yet." Yesh Atid's problems with the Ultra-Orthodox community go even further as the party seeks to institute civil and gay marriage equality in Israel, partial opening of public transport on Shabbat, and allowing for public funding of non-Orthodox Jewish movements within Israel, such as the Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic sects.<br></br>
  Even though Yesh Atid is the second largest party in the Knesset, there remains a strong possibility that Lapid will be given the mandate to form a government. Currently Yesh Atid is in talks with the heads of Labor, New Hope, Metetz, and Yisrael Beytenu and will likely meet with Blue and White, the Joint List, and Ra'am in an effort to build up what is being called the "Change Bloc." Lapid hopes to present the support of at least 61 MKs (members of Knesset) to President Reuven Rivlin who will give one MP the chance to form a government on April 7th.

          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain3();">Shas - 9</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation3" class="hide1">
  Founded in 1984 under the leadership of Chief Sephardi Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas (or שומרי ספרד Sephardic Guardians) is a political party whose stated goes is to represent the interests of religious Sephardic Jews (Jews who originated from Spain and the Middle East). For most of Israeli history, and primarily up until 1984, Sephardic Jews had been under-represented in politics and faced discrimination within Israeli society, whose interests leaned towards the wishes of the Ashkenazi secular Jews and Ashkenazi Haredim. <br></br>
  Shas considers its goal to be to "return the crown to its former glory" meaning to protect the Sephardic Jewish population from discrimination and to enshrine Sephardic religious and cultural heritage. Under the spiritual leadership of Ovadia Yosef, Shas encouraged the study of Torah and preferred to settle civil cases in religious courts rather than state ones. However, Shas still supports Jewish nationalism in Israel - doing so by advocating for Jews to make Aliyah and even supporting the IDF, considering their actions to fall under מלחמת מבצה or holy war done in defense - although has stopped short of advocating for Haredi men to draft. Although the relationship with the IDF hasn't always been friendly - Rabbi Yosef caused a major controversy in 2007 when he stated that it was no wonder Israeli soldiers were killed in battle since they didn't observe Torah. He has also said that the victims of the Holocaust were reincarnated sinners who were brought back and killed in order to atone for their past misdeeds. In spite of these controversial statements, Shas has sat with both left and right leaning parties, including in 1992 under Yitzhak Rabin's Labor party and in 2006 under Yehud Olmert, when Shas joined a coalition with Labor, Kadima, Gil, and Yisrael Beiteinu.<br></br>
  Shas is currently under the spiritual leadership of Shalom Cohen who, six months after the death of Ovadia Yosef, became the president of the מועצת חכמי התורה (the Council of Wise Torah Sages) the ultimate authority of Shas. Cohen has been an outspoken critic of the Modern Orthadox and secular Jew populations in Israel. He has discouraged his followers from using smartphones and also forbid women from studying in post high school academics. While in the past Shas had been open to a more centrist solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, supporting the peace agreements with Arab states while maintaining an undivided Jerusalem, recently the party has taken a far more Hawkish approach and opposes any freezing to settlements in the West Bank.<br></br>
  Within the Knesset, Aryeh Deri is the leader of Shas, also having been the founder of the Council and one of the founders of Shas. He is a controversial figures, particularly after he was convicted in 2000 of accepting $155,000 in bribes. After being released from prison 2 years later he returned to politics in 2013 - but stepped down again in 2014 after a video was released of former Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef called Deri a "wicked man and a thief." He none-the-less returned to the Knesset in 2015, but only served in cabinet positions while resigning from the Knesset itself.<br></br>
  Currently Aryeh Deri serves as the Minister of the Interior while he tries to balance both the nationalistic and religious obligations of Shas' voter base. To do this, Deri has aligned himself with the Netanyahu government, and even served as a key moderator between Netanyahu and Gantz in April 2020 when the two formed a unity government in the face of the Coronavirus pandemic. Deri only agreed to this unity government after Yair Lapid left Blue and White. After the most recent elections, Deri has made it clear that he would not support any unity coalition with Lapid's Yesh Atid party since he considers Lapid's interests to be contrary to those of the Haredi. Who serves as prime minister may be the least of his worries however, Deri may soon be facing legal problems of his own once again as he is set to be charged by the attorney general for numerous tax offenses.
</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain4();">Blue & White - 8</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation4" class="hide1">
  Founded in 2019, Blue & White was initially a political alliance that  consisted of former Chief of General Staff to the IDF, Benny Gantz's political party, Israel Resilience, former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon's Telem party, and Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid party. Both Yesh Atid and Telem split from Blue and White following the March 2020 elections in which Gantz agreed to form a unity government with Benjamin Netanyahu. Despite the split, Gantz was given approval to continue calling his party Blue and White.<br></br>
  As a centrist and liberal party Blue and White supports "separating" from the Palestinians while still maintaining and strengthening the settlement blocs in the West Bank. The party would only agree to a peace deal with the Palestinians providing that Israeli security forces would be allowed to enter Palestinian territories to fight terrorism, that the Jordan Valley would remain under Israeli control, Palestinians would not be granted the right of return, and Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. These demands were later abandoned once Blue and White entered a unity government with Netanyahu's Likud and agreed to an annexation plan brokered by the Trump administration.<br></br>
  Blue and White seeks to decentralize power from the Prime Minister - imposing term limits and demanding that all major and "historical diplomatic decision" require a supermajority vote in the Knesset for approval. At the same time, Blue and White wants to give greater autonomy to cities and communities - allowing them to decide for themselves whether or not they want to allow businesses to remain open or have public transportation on Shabbat. In order to curb corruption, Blue and White would seek to pass a bill that would forbid convicted politicians from running for office.<br></br>
  During the 2019 elections Gantz had promised that he would never sit in a government with Netanyahu. In an incredibly controversial move he rescinded on that promise in March 2020, the start of the Coronavirus pandemic, saying that “These are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions.” On April 20, 2020 Gantz and Netanyhu formed a "national emergency government." Under the agreement, Netanyahu would serve first for 18 months with Gantz becoming Prime Minister in November 2021. This agreement was ratified both by the Knesset and the supreme court. However there was a catch to this agreement. If a 2020 state budget wasn't passed then the Knesset would be dissolved and elections would be held on March 23, 2021... which is how we got to where we are today.<br></br>
  Blue and White was projected to do very poorly, with many wondering if they'd even pass the 3.25% threshold to be in the Knesset due to Gantz consistently butting heads with Netanyahu and for reversing on his promise to never sit in a Netanyahu-led Knesset. Many even suggested that Gantz was naïve and had been played by the Prime Minister. Despite this the party overperformed during elections, and Gantz emerged promising to unite the "Change Bloc" in order to overthrow Netanyahu. Currently Gantz is still the Minister of Defense in Netanyahu's transition government and, should a government fail to be formed, Gantz may very well still become Prime Minister in November 2021 as part of the legal emergency government agreement. 
</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain5();">Yamina - 7</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation5" class="hide1">
  Founded in 2019 as a political alliance between the New Right, The Jewish Home, and the Religious Zionist Party, Yamina is currently chaired by Naftali Bennett. With The Jewish Home and Religious Zionists having left the alliance, Yamina aims to be a home of right-wing nationalists frustrated with Netanyahu and disillusioned by their former Haredi allies.<br></br>
  Yamina has a hawkish political outlook, and believes in creating a single Jewish state that encompasses both Israel-proper and the West Bank. When it comes to issues of defense and terrorism, Yamina has promised to destroy Hamas and to take a firmer stance against terrorist demands, i.e. never agreeing to prisoner exchanges. Economically the party espouses many neo-liberal beliefs, Bennett has promised to lower taxes and encourage trickle-down policies that would benefit the high tech and housing while at the same time cracking down on labor unions. Yamina is also an advocate of judicial review which would place greater checks on the Supreme Court - which is widely considered to be a left leaning institution. <br></br>
  Naftali Bennett campaigned strongly against Netanyahu's handling of the Coronavirus pandemic. During the beginning of the outbreak, when Bennett was serving as Minister of Defense, he advocated for the IDF to take a larger role in combating the disease, using the Health Ministry in retraining redundant El Al workers to conduct epidemiological investigations, reducing the use of the Shin Bet and Mossad's cell phone tracking programs, and opening more military-run Coronavirus hotels. He even published a book <i>How to Beat an Epidemic</i> and has focused on the message that only he knows how to lead Israel in the post-Coronavirus world.<br></br>
  Currently Yamina is a wildcard in the race, with Bennett potentially being kingmaker in deciding to go with the "Change Bloc" or with a coalition led by Netanyahu. Currently Blue and White, New Hope, Labor, and even Meretz have stated they would be willing to support Bennett as Prime Minister, but going with them would mean aligning with a coalition that includes the Joint Arab List - which could alienate many of his right-wing voters and would serve as ammunition for the Likud to attack him for aligning with the left and center-left.
</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain6();">Yisrael Beitenu - 7</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation6" class="hide1">
  Avigdor Liberman's right-wing party has been a strong follower of Revisionist Zionism (the belief started by Zev Jabotinsky that advocated for settling both Israel, Palestine and even Transjordan) since its founding in 1999. At the time the party's primary voter base were immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Today the party has positioned itself as a right-wing secularist party, combining a hawkish foreign policy with an anti-religious domestic agenda.<br></br>
  Even though Revisionist Zionism does call for building a Jewish state on "Two Sides of the Joran River," Yisrael Beitenu acknowledges that nobody seriously believes anymore that Israel should encompass land that is currently claimed by Jordan. As a result, Yisrael Beitenu advocates for "unity of the people" over "unity of the land." To achieve that end, Yisrael Beitenu has pushed for a Palestinian policy that would result in West Bank settlements becoming part of Israel in exchange for large Arab cities in Israel becoming part of the Palestinian state and their residents losing their Israeli citizenship. Yisrael Beitenu would also demand from all their citizens, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, or political belief, that they draft into the IDF or engage in national service. This is outlined in the third of the party's 3 principles: No Citizenship Without Allegiance. This has created a massive rift between Liberman and the Ultra-Orthodox, who Liberman demands be drafted into the IDF. The party also advocates for an undivided Jerusalem being the capital of Israel.<br></br>
  Another major issue for Yisrael Beiteinu is the instability of the Israeli government, with the party pointing out that since 1948 there have been 35 governments, or on average a new government every 2 years. The party's proposed solution to this instability is to create a separation of powers in which the Prime Minister is given strong central powers with the Knesset acting as a check to the any executive overreach. Additionally, the ministers should not come from the Members of Knesset, but rather professionals trained in the field that coincides with their ministerial position. When it comes to the economy Yisrael Beitenu believes in investing in housing and education - offering 90% loans for home buyers and providing state run education facilities for children from age 6 months to 6 years.<br></br>
  Although the party had been a Likud ally for years, with Yisrael Beiteinu and Likud running a joint platform together in 2013, the two parties have since become much more adversarial. Beginning in 2018 Liberman quit Netanyahu's coalition over a Gaza ceasefire. This resulted in new elections in which Liberman supported Netanyahu forming a government, but refusing to sit in it due to his alliance with Ultra-Orthodox parties. He has since refused to sit in any coalition that is in partnership with any Ultra-Orthodox party. During the election Liberman announced that "the Ultra-Orthodox are flocking to the polls," a reference to Netanyahu using the same scare tactic by invoking the Arabs in 2015.<br></br>
  Most recently Liberman has positioned himself as being completely against a Netanyahu government. The Yisrael Beiteinu leader has proposed to pass a bill banning Netanyahu from forming a coalition and has promised to "do anything" to prevent another election. After a meeting with Yesh Atid, Liberman has since promised to support Lapid forming a new government, effectively aligning himself with the "Change Bloc."
</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain7();">United Torah Judaism - 7</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation7" class="hide1">
  United Torah Judaism was formed in 1992 as an alliance between Agudat Yisrael and Degel HeTorah with the goal of maximizing Ashkenazi Haredi presence in the Knesset. Although the party generally supports right-wing parties, in practice they hold religious concerns above all else. Their primary objective is to support the interests of the Ultra-Orthodox by securing welfare, preventing the passage of laws that would allow work on Shabbat, opposing separation of religion and state, and stopping the draft of Ultra-Orthodox men into the IDF. That being said, UTJ has been supportive of peace agreements with the Palestinians and was a part of the coalition that engaged in disengagement from the Gaza Strip.<br></br>
  Coming into the election United Torah Judaism is dealing with the massive fallout from the Coronavirus pandemic. Many of their constituents point to the high rate of infection amongst the Ultra-Orthodox resulting in a death rate much higher than the general population. The non-Hassidic Lithuanian community blame UTJ for not urging compliance with the Coronavirus regulations while many others in the community are angry at UTJ for the opposite reason - for not resisting the regulations enough which resulted in the closure of Synagogues and Yeshivas across the country. This inability of UTJ to fight against the government closures of yeshivas and synagogues resulted in former party leader Yaakov Litzman - who had been deputy Ministry of Health or Minister of Health since 2009 and during the pandemic - to drop to number two on the party list. Taking his place is Moshe Gafni - a lawmaker since 1988 who has also served as chair of the powerful and influential Knesset Finance Committee since 2009.<br></br>
  The party had received criticism leading up to the election once party leader Moshe Gafni said that he would be willing to go with another party - specifically Yamina's Naftali Bennett or New Hope's Gideon Sa'ar. After receiving significant criticism Gafni backtracked on that statement, saying that "the traditional public is with the Likud." While they are aligned with Netanyahu, not everything is peaceful. UTJ are angry with the Likud leader for what they perceive as driving their voters towards the Religious Zionism party led by Bezalel Smotrich. Despite that the party still did rather well, maintaining 7 seats which is only 1 down from their record of 8.
</div>
          <ul><button type="button"  class="politicalparty" onclick="explain8();">Labor - 7</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation8" class="hide1">
  Beginning in 1968 as a union between of three socialist parties (Mapai, Ahdut HaAvoda, and Rafi) Labor was very much at the center of every coalition until 1977 when the party lost to Likud for the first time. While Labor did make a comeback in 1984 due to popular disillusionment with the First Lebanon War, they have been on a decline since 1992. More recently, in April 2019, the party had its worst ever showing, in history earning only 6 seats. Party leader at the time, Avi Gabbay, received most of the blame - he had split the party from Tzipi Livni's Hatuna party and news came out that he had even considered joining a Likud-led coalition, all resulting in Gabbay's resignation. Subsequent elections did even worse, with Labor eventually sinking to only 3 seats, far below the 44 it had enjoyed in 1992.<br></br>
  While in the past Labor has often been perceived as Hawkish in its foreign policy, recently it has softened its approach significantly. Labor advocates for a strong military but also for a two-state solution coupled with economic investment in the Palestinian economy as a way to ensure a peaceful Palestinian state. Additionally Labor has pushed for separating from the West Bank settlements and cutting off all investment and funding within them. Another major foreign policy issue that Labor sees is the detachment from the Democratic party in the United States, a divide that Labor seeks to overcome.<br></br>
  Domestically Labor looks to invest in social programs such as welfare (particularly for the elderly), healthcare, education, public housing, public transportation, and agriculture. The party also advocates for a two-term limit for the Prime Minister while maintaining the power of the courts. The party unsurprisingly is also pushing for the opening of the economy on Shabbat, and allowing for both public transportation and for shops to be open each day of the week. In addition, a major Labor policy position is its outreach towards minority communities, specifically by adding an "equality clause" to the Basic Law and investing in housing and education in the Arab sector while also fully integrating them into Israeli society. Although Labor has so far made no mention of integrating the Arab sector into the IDF.<br></br>
  Currently the party is being led by Merav Michaeli who has campaigned on a "pink-collar workers' revolution," attempting to distinguish her party from the male-dominated field of Israeli politics. Specifically she has looked to include a year of maternity leave for either the mother or father after the birth of a child, free education from birth to the university level, and to reform the legal system's way of addressing sex crimes, child abuse, and sexual harassment.<br></br>
  This focus on economic issues, left-leaning social issues (marijuana legalization, gay marriage and adoption etc.), and focus on women has seemingly worked for Michaeli and her party, who now hold nearly twice as many seats as they did in the last Knesset. One thing Michaeli is known for is purposely mixing up gender pronouns when she speaks Hebrew as a way of reaching progressive and transgender voters, and has even split Labor's list between men and women. Although tensions ran high between Labor and parties like Blue and White, who Michaeli said "doesn't really stand for anything," she has so far not ruled out sitting with any party, including the Ultra-Orthodox, so long as they can oust Netanyahu.

          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty"  onclick="explain9();">Meretz - 6</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation9" class="hide1">
  Founded in 1992, Meretz is a social-democratic and green party, while also being the only major party in the Knesset that formally defines itself as left-wing. One of the biggest policies it advocates for is a two-state solution with the Palestinians that aligns with the Arab League's initiative, combined with full rights for Israel's Arab citizens.<br></br>
  In addition for its calls for a Palestinian state and the loosening of restrictions on the Gaza Strip, Meretz also looks to reduce corruption both politically and economically by advocating for a socio-democratic economic alternative to the capitalist direction advocated by Netanyahu and his government. Specifically raising taxes on the wealthiest citizens, fighting privatization of state resources, promoting workers' rights, increasing salaries for nurses and teachers, and redirecting government funds to offer free education from age 1 and lowering the cost of public medicine.<br></br>
  Meretz also considers itself a champion of the separation between the government and religion - pushing for civil marriage for all ethnicities, religions, and sexual orientations in Israel along with offering financial support for the activities of the gay community, surrogacy arrangements, and easing adoption services. In addition, Meretz is an advocate for environmental issues, coming in first with Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid party for its policies regarding the environment according to Vote Green's "Green Index."<br></br>
  While in 1992 the party earned its highest-ever Knesset representation with 12 seats as a part of Yitzhak Rabin's coalition government, Meretz has steadily been on the decline. Prior to the most recent election the party had only earned 3-5 seats, sometimes barely making it above the election threshold. Prior to the election there was concern about Meretz's performance due to fears of low turnout among the Arab population and due to party leader Nitzan Horowitz's support for an ICC probe into Israeli war crimes during the 2014 Gaza war and the 2018 protests.<br></br>
  Despite these concerns, the party had a successful outcome, winning 6 seats - the most since 2013 - running on a platform advocating for economic reform along with women and gay rights. Leader Nitzan Horowitz also made election history becoming the first openly gay leader of a political party along with the second openly gay Knesset member after Meretz lawmaker Uzi Even who served from 2002 to 2003. Meretz has promised to recommend Yair Lapid for prime minister after the election.
</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain10();">New Hope - 6</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation10" class="hide1">
  New Hope was founded in December of 2020 by former Likud politician Gideon Sa'ar after an unsuccessful run for Likud leadership in 2019 against Netanyahu earning only 27.5% of the vote against Netanyahu's 72.5%. After announcing the formation of his own party, polls placed New Hope at earning as many as 21 seats, but the next 3 months saw a dramatic drop eventually ending in New Hope receiving only 6 seats.<br></br>
  As a party New Hope has placed itself firmly on the right, even recruiting other Likud lawmakers such as Benny Begin (Menachem Begin's son), former Netanyahu ally Ze'ev Elkin, and chair of the coronavirus committee Yifat Shasha-Biton. Two major campaign promises are to reform the judicial system and to prioritize the settling of the West Bank - both issues strongly prioritized by the Israeli right. In addition, Sa'ar has criticized a two-state solution, saying that it would be a "mistake" to give up control over any of the lands that Israel currently occupies while also criticizing Netanyahu for offering any concessions to the Palestinian Authority.<br></br>
  Even though Sa'ar has placed himself to the right of Netanyahu on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, New Hope advocates for several issues that are supported by the left including advocating for legal adoption and civil marriage rights for gay couples, legalizing marijuana, and switching to renewable energy sources and other clean technologies.<br></br>
  Economically New Hope hopes to promote growth through a reduction in unemployment benefits while reinvesting funds into vocational training programs and increasing benefits for immigrants in hopes of attracting more educated Jews to boost the technology and other private sectors. In addition New Hope looks to reinvest in the education and healthcare sectors by hiring more healthcare works and teachers in order to open additional classes for struggling students.<br></br>
  In terms of government reforms New Hope has some interesting ideas. Their platform indicates that they are looking to reform the government, limiting the Prime Minister's tenure to 8 years while also reserving a portion of Knesset seats for local elections that would be elected by districts.<br></br>
  Since the most recent election Sa'ar and New Hope have been under intense pressure by Netanyahu to join his coalition - a tall order considering Sa'ar promised to never sit in a Netanyahu government - with reports that New Hope's number 2, Yifat Shasha-Biton, has been offered Education Minister if she defects from New Hope. More recently, reports from Kan indicate that Sa'ar would be willing to sit with the "Change Bloc" but only if Lapid agreed to a rotational government with Naftali Bennett.   
</div>
          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain11();">Joint List - 6</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation11" class="hide1">
  Formed in 2015, the Joint List started as a political alliance between 3 Arab parties (Balad, Ta'al and the United Arab List - better known as Ra'am) along with the left wing communist party, Hadash. Prior to the most recent election, Joint List enjoyed being the third largest faction in the Knesset, with their largest showing being in 2020 after they earned 15 seats. This was due to Joint List leader Ayman Odeh's campaign in Jewish areas, helping to draw voters away from the left-wing political parties who many voters saw as being on the decline. Even though the Joint List recommended and supported Benny Gantz during the 2020 elections, they remained in the opposition after Gantz created a unity government with Netanyahu.<br></br>
  Because the alliance is made up of a diverse set of parties their priorities vary somewhat when it comes to policy. Balad (which is a Hebrew acronym for National Democratic Assembly) draws on the support of Israeli Arabs and advocates for an Israeli state which isn't Jewish in nature. They party also demands that all settlements in the West Bank be evacuated, the separation fence be taken down, and all Palestinians be offered the right of return to their ancestral lands or compensation be given to those who are unable to. Balad also advocates for a two-state solution with the Palestinians, and that Israeli-Arabs be granted autonomy over deciding the educational curriculum in schools. Economically the party promotes left of center positions - the implementation of a capital gains tax for the wealthy and lower taxes for lower income earners. Balad is a secular party, advocating for separation between government and church but allowing for freedom of worship. The party is currently led by Mtanes Shihadeh, a former researcher who earned his PhD in international relations and wrote his dissertation on the impact of globalization on Jewish-Israeli voting patterns. The party has come under fire for its number two member, Heba Yazbak - a former PhD student and women's rights advocate, after she posted on Facebook a picture of Samir Kuntar. Kuntar murdered a father and his 4-year-old daughter, and during an escape attempt, killed a policeman. Yazbak referred to him in her post as a "martyr."<br></br>
  Ta'al is a Hebrew acronym for Arab Movement for Renewal and is similar to Balad in that it is also a secular party who advocates for a removal of all Jewish settlements in the West Bank, removal of Jewish icons from national symbols (such as the flag), removal of special privileges for Jews (such as the Aliyah for Jews), and a two-state solution based on the pre-1967 lines along with allowing for the Palestinian right of return. Ta'al is led by Ahmad Tibi - an Israeli politician and trained physician, known for having served as a political advisor to Yasser Arafat from 1993-1999. Although he often faces criticism for this past posting, he is also widely regarded as having given an incredibly moving speech in the Knesset on 2010 Holocaust Memorial Day, with Yair Lapid saying "it might have been the best speech ever given at the Israeli Parliament."<br></br>
  The third party in the Join List is Hadash a communist party who, despite its Marxist-Leninist roots, has included Arab nationalism in its platform and is often supported by middle class and secular Arabs. In fact, the leader of the party is Ayman Odeh, who is also the leader of the Joint List alliance. Much like Balad and Ta'al, Hadash advocates for a two-state solution, and was historically one of the first parties to do so. In line with its socialist principles, Hadash also advocates for the nationalization of all resources along with emphasizing workers' rights, social justice, environmental protection, the disarmament of nuclear weapons, and equality for Arab minority groups and women.<br></br>
  While the Joint List has generally cooperated, and seen political success as a result, there have been splits before Ra'am's most recent exit from the alliance. In 2019 Ta'al leader Ahmad Tibi pulled out of the party out of the alliance after he claimed that Ta'al wasn't getting enough seats. Ra'am's split has also been seen as responsible for the low Arab voter turnout in the election, in which both Joint List and Ra'am suffered from.<br></br>
  This is also matched by what some analysts believe to be a "new era" in Arab-Israeli politics. Many see the fading of the Palestinian struggle and the decline of Fatah in the West Bank as a turning point for Palestinian nationalists in Israel, who find it hard to advocate for Palestinian causes when even the Palestinian government has been silent for so long. As a result, Joint List ran a campaign that advocated more practical issues, primarily that the government take a stronger stance against organized crime and violence in the Israeli-Arab communities who see 17% more gun-related incidents than the rest of Israeli society. In addition, the party looks to make housing cheaper for Israeli-Arabs and looks to fight against the Nation-State Law which many Israeli-Arabs, but particularly the Druze who serve in the IDF, find racist and discriminatory. The alliance has seen popular support amongst the Israeli left as well, 62% of whom say that they want the Joint List in an anti-Netanyahu coalition. Currently Ta'al and Hadash leaders Ahmed Tibi and Ayman Odeh are expected to meet with Lapid to discuss joining the "Change Bloc" were as Balad leader Mtanes Shihadeh has refused to back any of the possible candidates for prime minister.

          <ul><button type="button" class="politicalparty" onclick="explain12();">Religious Zionist Party - 6</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation12" class="hide1">
  Originally known as Tekuma (Resurrection) the party was founded in 1998 in protest of the Wye River Memorandum (a negotiation brokered by the Clinton administration whereby Israel would put 2/5ths of the West Bank under Palestinian control) although the party had a poor initial showing in the 1999 elections, winning only 4 seats. The party has managed to stay active in the Knesset through an alliance initially with The National Union which consisted of right-wing Zionist and religious parties. By 2013 only Tekuma remained, and the party was branded as National Union-Tekuma. In order to bolster its support, the National Union-Tekuma formed an alliance with Yamina, called the Jewish Home, led by Naftali Bennett. This alliance ran again in 2019, this time under the Yamina joint list, and bolstered by the support of the Kahanist party, Otzma Yehudit.<br></br>
  Likely recognizing the threat that Yamina posed by trying to pull voters from both the secular and religious right, in 2020 Netanyahu entered into negotiations with the Yamina list and Jewish Home member Rabbi Rafi Peretz, who eventually abandoned Yamina in favor of joining Likud. By May 2020 Yamina had split with the Netanyahu led coalition as a result although shortly after, on January 20, 2021, Tekuma left Yamina as well, renaming itself the Religious Zionist Party, a coalition consisting of three groups: Religious Zionist led by Bezalel Smotrich, Oztma Yehudit led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, and Noam led by Avi Moaz. Currently Religious Zionist Party holds 4 seats while the other two have one.<br></br>
  The coalition is currently led by Bezalel Smotrich co-founder of Regavim, a pro settler NGO which takes legal action against any Palestinian or Bedouin construction undertaken without permission from the Israeli government. Prior to joining the Knesset, Smotrich participated in the infamous "Beast Parade," an event done to protest same-sex relationships in which anti-gay activists marched through Jerusalem with goats and donkeys to protest the "deviant acts" of same-sex relationships. He has also Tweeted that Jewish and Arab women should be segregated in maternity wards and advocates for Israel to be governed in accordance to religious law. During his time in the Knesset he is credited with helping to pass the anti-BDS law banning supporters of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement from visiting Israel and for initiating legislation forcing ministers, Knesset members, judges, senior military personal, and police officers to make their financial records public every 6 years. Initially, Smotrich was concerned with running with Otzma Yehudit, believing that the Khanist group would make Religious Zionism look too extreme. Eventually Smotrich capitulated after Netanyahu agreed to allow Religious Zionist Party member Ofir Sofar to join Likud, giving the party one extra member ahead of elections.<br></br>
  Head of the Otzma Yehudit party is Itamar Ben-Gvir, a lawyer known for defending right-wing Jewish radicals and for his association with the Kahanist movement. Kahanism was founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane, its political arm was the Kach party - which has been banned from running in elections and has been declared a terrorist organization by the US State Department - and whose notable members include Dr. Baruch Goldstein (shot and killed 29 Muslim worshipers at the Cave of Patriarchs in Hebron) and Yoel Lerner (who attempted to blow up the Dome of the Rock in order to rebuild the Temple Mount). Ben-Gvir has repeatedly claimed that the Arab citizens not loyal to Israel "must be expelled" and, until the 2020 elections, had a photo of Baruch Goldstein hanging in his home.<br></br>
  Combining the strength of these two parties with Noam - a conservative anti-LGBTQ party led by Avi Moaz, Religious Zionist Party was able to appeal to the diverse national-religious sector and far right, unencumbered by the more mainstream Yamina party. The party advocated on settling every hilltop of the West Bank and eventually forcing the Palestinian Authority out of existence. The party also advocates for reforming the judicial system by limiting the independence of courts, and of maintaining the power of the Orthodox Rabbinate while limiting Conservative and Reform Jewish influence in Israeli life. As a result, the party saw significant support from the Chabad movement whose numbers are estimated to be between 30,000 - 40,000 voters.<br></br>
  After being considered to be an "acceptable alternative" to his own party by Prime Minister Netanyahu, the National Zionist Party has declared its support for Netanyahu to lead the government. However, friction within the potential Netanyahu coalition has arisen between National Zionist and Ra'am - the right-wing Islamic party whose platform of "practical politics" suggests it might be open to sitting in a Netanyahu government - but who most in the religious Zionist community refuse to be in a coalition with.
</div>
          <ul><button type="button"  class="politicalparty" onclick="explain13();">Ra'am - 4</ul></p></button>
<div id="explanation13" class="hide1">
  Founded in 1996 Ra'am (the Hebrew word for 'Thunder' but also an acronym for the United Arab List) is similar to the other Arab parties on the Joint List: The party advocates for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces to the 1967 line, a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, the right of Palestinian refugees to settle in their ancestral lands in Israel, repealing of the Nation-State law (the law which defines Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people) and to separate religion and state.<br></br>
  What sets them apart from the rest of the Joint List is that, unlike Ta'al and Balad, Ra'am is not a secular party, but is rather the political arm of the Islamic Movement in Israel - an organization that advocates for Islam to have a greater presence in Israel and is prominent amongst Israeli-Arabs and Circassians. True to their conservative platform, Ra'am is against LGBTQ rights, going against the rest of the Joint List to vote against a summer 2020 bill banning gay conversion therapy in Israel with one Ra'am Knesset Member, Walid Taha, saying that the "phenomenon of gays is almost nonexistent in Arab society." But the most significant difference between Ra'am and the Joint List comes from their leader, Mansour Abbas, who has so far not ruled out sitting in a coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu.<br></br>
  Mansour Abbas surprised Israelis across the political spectrum when, in October 2020, he helped to block a probe initiated by the opposition in the Knesset that attempted to investigate the Submarine Affair (during which high ranking members of the government were allegedly bribed to purchase submarines from the German company Thyssenkrupp, in order to raise the stock price of SeaDrift Coke, a supplier to that company. Netanyahu reportedly sold shares of SeaDrift Coke 3 years after the purchase for an almost $4 million profit) and has even stated publicly that he might be willing to grant Netanyahu immunity as part of a quid pro quo. Abbas went on to justify his actions by saying that "We are not in the pockets of the Left or the Right. We need to act within the interest of the Arab society that chose us."<br></br>
  The voters who choose Ra'am generally tend to be Bedouins, 60% of whom live in villages unrecognized by the state and, as a result, see frequent home demolitions. Ra'am seeks to change that by repealing a 2017 law that allows for stricter penalties for illegal Arab construction. To create this lasting change Abbas sees working with Netanyahu as potentially necessary saying, "There's only one premier and that's Netanyahu, he is the address for these demands." While currently Ra'am is reportedly leaning towards a Netanyahu-led government, reports from within Ra'am suggest that this could change depending on the situation. Labor leader Merav Michaeli has also tried to court Ra'am, and what the party will decide could potentially dictate who becomes Prime Minister. Regardless of that though, the fact that an Arab-Israeli party is willing to sit with the right, which many in the Joint List considered a red line, may have a rippling effect that changes future politics in the Arab-Israeli sector.

        <h2>So this leads to the biggest question: who won?</h2>
        <p>
          At the moment - nobody - and we may not have that answer for a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          While that question is being answered there are a few things we need to understand. The Israeli political system is very different from the American or even the British - even though the later also follows a parliamentary system - and as a result we should all make sure we're on the same page.
        <section class="questionaire">

            How is a government decided in Israel?</button>
          </div><br>
          <div id="answer1" class="hide"><br></br>
            As we said, it is a parliamentary system in Israel and, as a result, voters cast ballots based on political parties rather than specific individuals (even though certain individuals may be the face of a party). There are 120 seats in the Israeli parliament, aka the Knesset, and whoever holds a majority of those seats would pick a prime minister and run the country. HOWEVER, in all of Israel's history no single party has ever won a majority (61 seats) meaning that different political parties must form coalitions with each other in order to hold power.

          Okay, so who decides who gets to form a coalition?</button>
          </div><br>
        <div id="answer2" class="hide">
          <br></br>The president of Israel is the person who gets to assign the responsibility of forming a government! <br>
        </br> The Basic Laws (which are the constitutional laws governing the state in the absence of an actual constitution) say that the president has 7 days after the election results are published to assign the task to one lucky Knesset Member (KM). That person has 28 days to form a coalition although they can request an additional 14 days for a total for 42 days.<br></br> 
        <div>
          <button type="button" class="question1" name="tab"

        How does the president decide?</button>
      </div>
      <div id="answer4" class="hide1"><br></br>
        Good question - and to be honest the Basic Laws don't provide a clear answer. It's primarily up to the president's discretion to decide which volunteer gets to form a government. The only exception is if the Knesset has voted to dissolve itself, during which the President must wait until after the election before assigning that duty to someone.

        </div><br>
        <div id="answer3" class="hide"><br></br>
          Typically the president assigns the duty to the leader of the largest party, but it's not a requirement. Ideally the president would give the responsibility to whoever has the greatest chance of actually forming a functioning government.
